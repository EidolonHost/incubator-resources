OKRs
========

#Introduction
OKR, which stands for Objectives and Key Results, is a planning and goal setting technique made famous by Intel and Google. OKRs represent aggressive goals and define the measurable steps you’ll take towards achieving those goals. They’re typically used to set quarterly goals, but can also be used for annual planning.

OKRs are set at the company, team, and individual level.

#Process

###Beginning of quarterly

1. Each employee is asked to submit OKRs they think the company should prioritize.

2. Each employee is asked to submit OKRs they think the department should prioritize.

    Departments are as follows:

    - Engineering
        - Consists of all engineers - Bruno is responsible to collect them
    - Design
        - Consists of all designers - Vicky is responsible to collect them
    - Marketing
        - Consists of everyone - Cody is responsible to collect them
    - Sales
        - Consists of non-engineers and non-designers - Cody is responsible to collect them
    - Finance
        - Consists of Vincent and Cody - Cody is responsible to collect them
    - Project/Product management
        - Consists of anyone managing a project - Vincent is responsible to collect them


3. Company OKRs are derived from employee input and put together by Cody with input from team leads.

4.  A staff meeting is held to collectively develop team objectives and align them with company goals.

5. Employees then set individual OKRs that reflect and support larger company and team goals, and meet with their team leads to discuss what they want to work on in the upcoming quarter and what they believe is the best use of their time. During this discussion, the employee and team lead develop and negotiate the specifics of each OKR.

Note: These are visible to the ENTIRE team.

###Middle of quarter
Teams, team leads, and employees often hold a mid-quarter check-up meeting to share progress and make any adjustments. Annual OKRs in particular needn’t be set in stone: if you’ve discovered that the assumptions you made last year aren’t accurate, there’s no need to stubbornly stick to them.

###End of quarter

1. OKRs are graded. If your OKR is to “Increase the number of users logging in at least 3x a week by 30%” and you managed to increase it 15%, give yourself a score of 0.5. You can average your key results grades into a total Objective score, and if you like, you can average all of your Objective scores to see your overall grade for the quarter/year.

According to Google, failing to meet your OKR goals is better than overshooting them by a wide margin. If your company or team is always scoring “1″s across the board, your high-level OKRs aren’t ambitious enough. It’s better to set a challenging goal than play it safe! Shoot for the moon, and be satisfied with hitting at least 60-70% of your goal.

2. Wrap-up meeting where everyone shares their grades, explains their results, and outlines the adjustments they’re going to make for the next quarter.

3. Reflect on the results and prepare to set next Quarter's OKRs.
